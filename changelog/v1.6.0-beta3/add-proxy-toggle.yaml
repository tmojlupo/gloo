    description: >-
      Fix the validation API to only return proxies that would be generated by proposed resources if requested. This
      change means the default behavior matches the kubernetes validation webhook API. By including the top-level
      value `returnProxies=true` in the json/yaml request to the API, you can signal the endpoint to return the proxies
      that would be generated (previously, always returning by default).
