  - type: HELM
    issueLink: https://github.com/solo-io/gloo/issues/3753
    description: >-
      Removed the `global.wasm.enabled` HELM value for toggling experimental wasm support.
      Wasm is now enabled by default. This flag is no longer required as there is no more need
      for a separate gateway-proxy image since wasm support was merged into upstream envoy.
