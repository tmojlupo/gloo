      Allow automatic discovery of TLS when using consul services. Requires serveral changes to gloo's helm config to use:
      Set the `settings.integrations.consul.useTls` flag to true.
      Assign a tag for gloo to recognize as the TLS tag if the default (settings.integrations.consul.tlsTagName=glooUseTls) is insufficient.
      Add the consul root CA for gloo to use at settings.integrations.consul.rootCA
      Once these are setup in gloo, adding the tlsTagName value as a tag to consul services should cause upstreams to automatically
      have TLS when discovered by gloo. As part of this change, the behavior of tag matching between gloo upstreams
      and consul service instances was changed from an exact set match to a subset match.
      Now a match is found if an upstream's instanceTags are a subset of a service instance's tags.
