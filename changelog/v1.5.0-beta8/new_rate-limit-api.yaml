  description: >
    Define the API to enforce rate limit policies using `RateLimitConfig` resources.
    The API allows users to apply policies by referencing a set of `RateLimitConfig`
    resources on `VirtualHosts` and `Routes`. Each resource represents a rate limit policy
    that will be independently enforced on the routing resource that references it.
    Please see the [docs](https://docs.solo.io/gloo-edge/latest/guides/security/rate_limiting/crds)
    for a detailed explanation of the new API.
