    issueLink: https://github.com/solo-io/gloo/issues/3470
    description: >
      Add 'omitempty' tag to all values defined in the gloo chart, and made most primitive
      values pointers to said values instead. Also added a test to ensure that new
      values require these features as well. Finally, modified a couple chart values to avoid plugging
      in nil values.
