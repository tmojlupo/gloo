      Gloo Edge now proactively reports warnings on virtual services that have matchers that are short-circuited.
      To enable, update the Gloo `Settings` such that `spec.gateway.validation.warnRouteShortCircuiting=true`
      The cases now additionally covered are:
        - routes that have simple OR regex header matchers, ensuring each one of the OR'ed matchers can be reached
        - the same logic, but with method matchers
      In addition, we support aggressively reporting errors on virtual services with invalid regex matchers. (no need
      to enable short-circuiting reporting)
