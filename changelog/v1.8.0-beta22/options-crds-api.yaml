    description: >
      Introduced new `VirtualHostOption` and `RouteOption` CRDs, which allow users to externalize
      `options` configuration from VirtualHosts and Routes. Routes and VirtualHosts can now delegate
      options configuration to multiple of these custom resources, allowing config reuasability and
      less noisy Virtualhosts and Routes.
