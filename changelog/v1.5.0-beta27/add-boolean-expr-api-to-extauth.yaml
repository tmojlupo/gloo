    description: >-
      Add API to `AuthConfig` that allows users to specify a boolean expression to determine how to evaluate auth
      configs within an auth chain. Previously, each config on an auth config must be authorized for the entire request
      to be authorized. This remains the default, but now users can additionally specify a boolean expression (the
      `booleanExpr` field on an auth config) to reference the auth configs and AND/OR/NOT them together to achieve the
      desired access policy.
