    description: >-
      Implement _enterprise-only_ advanced HTTP health checking API for envoy. Previously, Gloo supported
      per-endpoint paths in the HTTP health checking config on static upstreams. After this change we support
      per-endpoint method configuration of the HTTP health check requests to static upstreams, as well as complex
      regex json / regex parsing of the HTTP response to make determination on the HTTP health check response (rather
      than just look at the HTTP status, like upstream envoy). Regex/json parsing of the response can be configured
      in the `ResponseAssertions` field on the upstream's HTTP health check.
