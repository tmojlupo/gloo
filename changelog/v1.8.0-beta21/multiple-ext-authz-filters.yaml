    description: >
      Introduce API for a new enterprise-only feature of configuring
      multiple ext auth servers in Settings. Allow for configuring
      an ext_authz filter that points to one of those servers per route.
      Allow `stat_prefix` to be enabled for an ext_authz filter.
      This is an additional prefix that is used when emitting statistics.
