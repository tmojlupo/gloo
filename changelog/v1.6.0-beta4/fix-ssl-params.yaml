    description: >-
      Fix an issue where ssl configurations across different virtual services may be incorrectly
      cached if they ssl configurations only differ by ssl-parameters (e.g., min tls version).
      **After this change, ssl configurations that are only different by ssl parameters must have different sni domains.**
      Prior to this change, such a configuration would not error but could result in one ssl configuration being selected over another;
      now an explicit error is recorded on the virtual service.
