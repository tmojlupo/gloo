changelog:
- type: NEW_FEATURE
  description: >
    Define the API to allow for set-style rate limiting.
    The previous rate-limiting implementation uses a tree structure for descriptors.
    This adds capability to use a set structure instead, where the descriptors are treated as an unordered set
    such that a given rule will apply if all the relevant descriptors match, regardless of the values of the other descriptors and regardless of descriptor order.
    For example, the rule may require `type: a` and `number: 1` but the `remote_address` descriptor can have any value.
    This can also be understood as `remote_address: *` where * is a wildcard.
