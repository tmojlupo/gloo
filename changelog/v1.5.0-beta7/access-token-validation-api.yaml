    description: >
      Define the API to specify access token validation for external authentication in Gloo Enterprise. This
      API allows for a user to perform additional validation on the access token received during an OAuth2.0 flow and
      use it in authorization decisions. The userinfo metadata can also be queried and leveraged in an extauth plugin.
      Further, users can perform the first leg of an OAuth2.0 flow outside of Gloo and only use Gloo to validate access
      tokens that have been provided on the incoming request.
