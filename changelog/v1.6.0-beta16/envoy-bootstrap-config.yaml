    Add the ability to add static clusters to the envoy bootstrap config via helm. This option can be accessed via
    "<proxy-name>.envoyStaticClusters". The value should be a list of static clusters which will be passed directly to
    envoy, so the yaml must be correct. The api can be found here: https://www.envoyproxy.io/docs/envoy/latest/api-v3/config/cluster/v3/cluster.proto#config-cluster-v3-cluster.
    This is meant to be used for advanced use cases

  description: >
    Add the ability to add bootstrap extensions to the envoy bootstrap config via helm. This option can be accessed via
    "<proxy-name>.envoyBootstrapExtensions". The value should be a list of bootstrap extensions which will be passed directly
    envoy, so the yaml must be correct. The main use case being wasm services, for the purpose of creating singletons.
    Bootstrap extensions is a list of typed extension config (https://www.envoyproxy.io/docs/envoy/latest/api-v3/config/core/v3/extension.proto#envoy-v3-api-msg-config-core-v3-typedextensionconfig)
    so the list must be passed with the name, and type url.
    The API for the wasm service specfically can be found here: https://www.envoyproxy.io/docs/envoy/latest/api-v3/extensions/wasm/v3/wasm.proto#extensions-wasm-v3-wasmservice.
