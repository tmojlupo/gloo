    description: >-
      Add new field `inheritableMatchers` boolean field (default false) to virtual services and route tables that,
      when true, changes how route delegation handles header, method, and query parameter matchers from the parent
      resource. By default, route tables must have matchers that are a superset of those from the parent, as this
      improves readability. By setting `inheritableMatchers` to true, any header, method, and query parameter matchers
      from the parent that are absent from the child will be automatically included on the generated route.
