  - type: NEW_FEATURE
    description: >
      Expose the raw envoy configuration for the gRPC to JSON transcoding filter, which can be leveraged to expose a
      gRPC service both as a gRPC service and as a REST API. Exposing the underlying envoy configuration allows users
      more granular control over the gRPC to JSON mappings than the current Gloo API for gRPC to JSON (that doesn't
      require explicit protobuf descriptors to be provided since they will be discovered). One example where users
      may want more granular control of their gRPC to JSON mappings may be to leverage query parameter transcoding.
