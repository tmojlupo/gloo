    description: Allow users to specify extra headers for health check requests as secrets. New gloo secret type "header", containing header name-value pairs, can now be created (details [here](https://docs.solo.io/gloo/latest/guides/traffic_management/request_processing/health_checks/)). Health checks can reference header secrets for additional headers to add in addition to specifying them explicitly.
