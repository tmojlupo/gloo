    description: >
      Introduce an API to support a passthrough grpc ext auth service. This service authorizes
      requests by delegating to an external service which implements the envoy external auth API:
      https://github.com/envoyproxy/envoy/blob/ae1ed1fa74f096dabe8dd5b19fc70333621b0309/api/envoy/service/auth/v3/external_auth.proto#L29

      This enables GlooE users to use custom external auth services in addition to GlooE out of the box features,
      without requiring users to write and maintain extauth go plugins
