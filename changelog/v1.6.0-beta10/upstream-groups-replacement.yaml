    description: >- 
      Fixed a bug where invalid route replacement did not correctly replace
      routes that referred to a missing `UpstreamGroup`, which potentially resulted
      in incorrect config being sent to envoy. Now, the route will be replaced correctly
      according to the invalid config policy.
