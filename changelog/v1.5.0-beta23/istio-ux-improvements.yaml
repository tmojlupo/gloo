changelog:
  - type: NEW_FEATURE
    description: >-
      Added improvements to the user experience for using gloo with Istio. Added helper commands for glooctl,
      so that users can simply perform `glooctl istio inject` and `glooctl istio enable-mtls --upstream foo` 
      in order to have Gloo and Istio up and running and communicating together over mTLS.
