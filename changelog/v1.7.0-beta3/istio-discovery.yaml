    description: >-
      Add 3 configuration values under global.istioIntegration to control automatic discovery and sidecar
      injection for Gloo pods by Istio. LabelInstallNamespace adds a label to mark the namespace for Istio discovery if the namespace is
      designated to be created in the chart. WhitelistDiscovery explicitly annotates Gloo's discovery pod for Istio sidecar injection.
      DisableAutoinjection annotates all pods that aren't more specifically noted elsewhere never receive Istio sidecar injection.
