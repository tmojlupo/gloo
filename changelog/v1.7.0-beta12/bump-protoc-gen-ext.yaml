    description: |
      Fixed a bug where some protobufs were erroneously being considered
      equal when comparing values inside of a `oneOf` interface. This resulted
      in some subtle bugs where sometimes proxies would not receive updates
      when reconciled in certain situations where only very small changes were made.

      This bug affected Gloo Edge 1.6.0 to 1.6.6 and 1.7.0-beta1 to 1.7.0-beta11 versions only.
