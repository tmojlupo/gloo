changelog:
  - type: NEW_FEATURE
    description: >
      Allow enabling mTLS authentication between the Gloo control plane and Envoy instances. Since the Envoy
      configuration can contain secret data, plaintext communication between Gloo and Envoy is too insecure
      in certain scenarios (e.g. if your setup has the Gloo control plane and Envoy instances running in separate
      clusters). Turning on mTLS will encrypt the xDS communication between Gloo and Envoy.

  - type: HELM
    description: |
      We are introducing a new Helm value `global.glooMtls.enabled` to enable mTLS between Gloo and Envoy. An example of a helm override file that enables MTLS authentication is:
        ```
        global:
          glooMtls:
            enabled: true
        ```
        For more information, check out the [corresponding documentation](https://docs.solo.io/gloo-edge/latest/security/mtls/).
