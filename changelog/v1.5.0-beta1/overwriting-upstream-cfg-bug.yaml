  description: >
    Fix bug in UDS where Health Checks and Outlier Detection config are being overwritten by updated upstreams. In
    addition add the `UseHttp2` option to the list of checked fields. Part of this involved switching the UseHttp2
    option on the Upstream to a `wrappers.BoolValue`. This has no impact on the API itself, but only on the Go
    implementations.
