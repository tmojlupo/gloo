changelog:
  - type: FIX
    issueLink: https://github.com/solo-io/gloo/issues/4008
    description: >-
      Fix a bug where the `inheritableMatchers` value itself was being read from the parent route, rather than the
      child route (as documented and intended).
  - type: NEW_FEATURE
    issueLink: https://github.com/solo-io/gloo/issues/3726
    description: >-
      Add support for the new `inheritablePathMatchers` value on `Route` config. This new setting is similar to the
      `inheritableMatchers` boolean value that allows delegated routes (i.e., routes on route tables) to optionally
      opt into inheriting HTTP header, method, or query parameter matching from the parent route. The new
      `inheritablePathMatchers` is used to optionally opt into inheriting HTTP path matcher config from the parent.
