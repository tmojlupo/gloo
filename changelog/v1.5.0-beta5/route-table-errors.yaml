- type: FIX
  description: >
    Properly validate `RouteTable` routes without matchers. Like with regular `VirtualService` routes, these routes will
    be assigned the default `/` prefix matcher. Consequently, the route is valid only if the parent route also has a
    `\` prefix matcher (either explicitly defined, or by default).

  description: >
    Report delegation cycle errors on the offending `RouteTable`, not only on `VirtualServices` that use the table.
