    description: >
      Previously, GPL License checking and generating open source attribution docs required a manual list of
      gloo packages to be kept so that we could analyze their dependencies. Now, the go-list-licenses
      repo can automatically find all packages by running `go list ./...` and will analyze the dependencies of all
      found packages.
