    description: >
      Provides an enterprise-only option to use the leftmost IP address from
      the x-forwarded-for header and set it as the downstream address. This is useful if the network topology
      (load balancers, etc.) prior to gloo is unknown or dynamic. If using this option, be sure to sanitize this
      header from downstream requests to prevent security risks.
