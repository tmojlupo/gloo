    description: >-
       Add ability for the Gloo Edge Enterprise external auth server to validate OAuth 2.0 access tokens based on access token scopes. 
       The new `requiredScopes` field of AccessTokenValidation can be used to specify a list of required scopes for a token.
       Omitting the field means that scope validation is skipped.
