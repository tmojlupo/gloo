    description: >
      It was possible to install mTLS, enable it on upstreams, remove mTLS and the configuration still
      be defined on upstreams. This caused the data plane to become out of sync,
      since envoy clusters would be configured to get their secrets from a non-existent cluster.
      Add protection to the `glooctl istio uninject` command to prevent users from unknowingly
      causing the data plane to become out of sync.
