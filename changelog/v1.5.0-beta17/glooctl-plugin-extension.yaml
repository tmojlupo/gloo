      description: >
        Support a Kubernetes-style plugin system for glooctl.
        (See https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/extend-kubectl/kubectl-plugins/).
        This allows users to invoke arbitrary binary plugins via glooctl <plugin-name>, where a plugin is
        defined as any executable on the user's PATH that is prefixed with glooctl-.
