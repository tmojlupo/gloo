    description: >
      CPU profile of Gloo at scale (5000+ upstreams) indicated that the `endpointsForUpstream` function was taking
      upwards of 5 seconds of CPU on a ~50 second sample. This change optimizes the code by using a map instead of
      looping over all endpoints for each upstream.
