    Define the API to specify Prioritized Failover in Gloo. This API allows for a user to define a list of endpoint
    sets which will be used in the case that the main upstream endpoint becomes unhealthy. Failover supports optional
    locality weighted load balancing which assigns additional weighted load balancing based on the locality
    assigned to each of the endpoint sets.
