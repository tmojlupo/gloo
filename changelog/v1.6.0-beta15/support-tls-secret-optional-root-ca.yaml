    description: >
      cert-manager can be used to create a Certificate (https://cert-manager.io/docs/concepts/certificate/). This
      is used to generate a TLS key and certificate, and they are stored in a Kubernetes secret. This can be
      configured to include an optional property on the secret, ca.crt, which holds a root CA certificate.
      If cert-manager is used to generate this Kubernetes secret, and the root CA certificate is included,
      we were not including it when converting to a Gloo secret, causing Gloo to crash.
