      When looking at enterprise changelogs, it is useful for customers and field engineers to have reference to which gloo OSS version the enterprise version relies on. This adds a link to the enterprise changelog docs next to each version.
      In addition, enterprise changelogs will also include changes from the corresponding Open source versinos of gloo edge.
