changelog:
- type: NEW_FEATURE
  description: >
    Added the new `transport_api_version` field to the `extauth` settings. The field determines the API version
    for the `ext_authz` transport protocol that will be used by Envoy to communicate with the auth server.
    The currently allowed values are `V2` and `V3`, with the former being the default; this was done to maintain
    compatibility with existing custom auth servers.
    Note that in order for the external auth server to be able to emit dynamic metadata the field needs to be set to `V3`.
    For more info, see the `transport_api_version` field
    [here](https://www.envoyproxy.io/docs/envoy/latest/api-v3/extensions/filters/http/ext_authz/v3/ext_authz.proto#extensions-filters-http-ext-authz-v3-extauthz).
