    description: >
      CPU profile of Gloo at scale (5000+ upstreams) indicated that the `generateXDSSnapshot` function was taking
      upwards of 5 seconds of CPU on a ~50 second sample. This change optimizes the code by using creating hashes for
      the XDS snapshot using deterministic proto marshalling and fnv hashing rather than the reflection-based
      `mitchellh/hashstructure` which was benchmarked to be several orders of magnitude slower.
