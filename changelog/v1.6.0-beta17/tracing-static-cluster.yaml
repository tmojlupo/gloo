    description: >
      When configuring tracing, you can specify a cluster where traces are collected.
      If the collector is an upstream, tracing works as expected. However, if the cluster is
      statically defined in the envoy bootstrap, traces do not get collected. This adds support for
      statically defined tracing collector clusters.
