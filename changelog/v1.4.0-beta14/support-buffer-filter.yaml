      description: >
        Gloo now supports enabling the Envoy buffer filter by configuring `spec.httpGateway.options.buffer` of the desired Gateway.
        This can also be overridden on virtual services at the virtual host or route level, and on weighted destinations.
        See [envoy buffer](https://www.envoyproxy.io/docs/envoy/latest/api-v3/extensions/filters/http/buffer/v3/buffer.proto#extensions-filters-http-buffer-v3-buffer)
        for more details.
