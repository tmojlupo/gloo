    description: >
      Fixes duplicate versions issue in our [security scan docs](https://docs.solo.io/gloo-edge/master/reference/security-updates/enterprise/).
      Also allows us to run security scans on individual versions that may be missing security scans because more than one version was
      released in between weekly security scans.
