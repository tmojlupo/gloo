### Small bug fixes

If your bug fix is small (around 20 lines of code) just open a pull request. We will try to merge it as soon as possible, 
just make sure that you include a test that verifies the bug you are fixing.

### Big PRs

This includes:

- Big bug fixes
- New features

For significant changes to the repository, it‚Äôs important to settle on a design before starting on the implementation. Reaching out to us early will help minimize the amount of possible wasted effort and will ensure that major improvements are given enough attention.

1. **Open an issue.** Open an issue about your bug in this repo.
2. **Message us on Slack.** Reach out to us to discuss your proposed changes.
3. **Agree on implementation plan.** Write a plan for how this feature or bug fix should be implemented. Should this be one pull request or multiple incremental improvements? Who is going to do each part?
4. **Submit a work-in-progress PR** It's important to get feedback as early as possible to ensure that any big improvements end up being merged. Submit a pull request and label it `wip` to start getting feedback.
5. **Review.** At least one Solo team member should sign off on the change before it‚Äôs merged. Look at the ‚Äúcode review‚Äù section below to learn about what we're looking for.
6. **A Solo team member will merge and release!**

### Code review guidelines

It‚Äôs important that every piece of code in Gloo Edge is reviewed by at least one Solo team member familiar with that codebase.

1. **Changelog** Every PR in Gloo Edge needs a changelog entry. For more information about changelogs, see the [readme](https://github.com/solo-io/go-utils/tree/master/changelogutils). 
2. **CI check** A Solo team member needs to kick off the CI process by commenting `/test` on your PR.
3. **Testing** Please write tests for your changes. Bias towards fast / unit testing. 
4. **Comments** The code reviewer may leave comments to discuss changes. Minor preferences are often called out with `nit`. 

### Testing with coverage:

To see coverage, run your tests in the package like so

```
ginkgo -cover && go tool cover -html *.coverprofile
