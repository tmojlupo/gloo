# Gloo docs

## Deploying to a test site

```
make serve-site
```

## Deploying to a versioned test site

To test the versioned docs locally:

```
eval $(minikube docker-env)
```

Run `docker pull` to get the appropriate gloo-docs images (e.g. `docker pull gcr.io/solo-public/gloo-docs:1.2.0`).

```
kubectl apply -f docs-staging.yaml
```

Then run `glooctl proxy url` to find the address to go to (e.g. http://some-ip-address:30357/gloo/latest).

## Notes about the build process

- we want documentation to be available in the form of docs.solo.io/gloo/latest/... and also as docs.solo.io/gloo/<some_version/...

  - during the release process, we will replace the prior "latest" build with the new build
  - if we want to make a particular version of the docs available for a longer timespan, we can host the version-scoped image
- we currently emit two images for each Gloo release
  - a version of the docs that is served under domain.com/gloo/latest/
  - a version of the docs that is served under domain.com/gloo/[version]/
- the two images are built in the following temporary directories
  - site-latest/
  - site-versioned/
- in the Dockerfile, we copy the appropriate directories to a nested directory corresponding to the prefix path
- all urls are scoped relative to the prefix path
- if you want to run locally, do: `make serve-site` which will build and serve the site from the site/ directory, with no prefix

### Push images

Normally, CI will handle docs image pushes. If you want to force an image push, you can use this command from the repo root directory.
```
GCLOUD_PROJECT_ID=<project-id> TAGGED_VERSION=<some-version> make publish-docs -B
```



# Shortcode/Hugo tips
- Shortcodes cannot be embedded in other shortcodes
  - This means the "readfile" shortcode does not interpolate shortcodes embedded within the file
  - "Nesting" is different and allowed: you can "nest" short codes in the same manner that you can nest html tags
