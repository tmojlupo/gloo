title: Authenticate with Okta
weight: 10
description: Integrating Gloo Edge and Okta Identity Cloud
---

[Okta](https://okta.com) is an [OpenID Connect](https://openid.net) identity hub. Okta can be used to expose a consistent 
OpenID Connect interface to your applications while allowing your users to authenticate using credentials 
managed by Okta.

In this guide we will see how to authenticate users with your application via an OIDC flow that uses Okta as the identity 
provider. This guide is an example to get you started for test purposes with Okta.  It omits many of the factors that need to be considered for full production deployments.

First, we will use Gloo Edge to expose a simple [httpbin](https://httpbin.org/) Service running on Kubernetes.

Second, we’ll secure the access using Okta OIDC.  Okta will return a JWT token, and we’ll use Gloo Edge to extract some claims from this token create new headers corresponding to these claims.

Finally, we’ll see how Gloo Edge RBAC rules can be created to leverage the claims contained in the JWT token.

## Expose a Kubernetes Service

### Deploy the Service

Start by deploying the `httpbin` service on a Kubernetes cluster.  Use `kubectl` to apply the resources below to your cluster.  

{{< notice note >}}
This example was created and tested using a GKE cluster running k8s v1.16.13, but other platforms and versions should work as well.
{{< /notice >}}

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: ServiceAccount
metadata:
  name: httpbin
---
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: httpbin
  labels:
    app: httpbin
spec:
  ports:
  - name: http
    port: 8000
    targetPort: 80
  selector:
    app: httpbin
---
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: httpbin
spec:
  replicas: 1
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: httpbin
      version: v1
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: httpbin
        version: v1
    spec:
      serviceAccountName: httpbin
      containers:
      - image: docker.io/kennethreitz/httpbin
        imagePullPolicy: IfNotPresent
        name: httpbin
        ports:
        - containerPort: 80
```

### Verify the Upstream

Gloo Edge discovers Kubernetes services automatically.  So, running the `glooctl get upstreams` command, you should be able to see a new Gloo Edge Upstream `default-httpbin-8000`, based on the naming convention `namespace-serviceName-portNumber`:

```shell
% glooctl get upstreams default-httpbin-8000
+----------------------+------------+----------+------------------------+
|       UPSTREAM       |    TYPE    |  STATUS  |        DETAILS         |
+----------------------+------------+----------+------------------------+
| default-httpbin-8000 | Kubernetes | Accepted | svc name:      httpbin |
|                      |            |          | svc namespace: default |
|                      |            |          | port:          8000    |
|                      |            |          |                        |
+----------------------+------------+----------+------------------------+
```

### Create the Virtual Service

Use `kubectl` to create the following Gloo Edge Virtual Service that will route all requests from domain `glootest.com` to the new Upstream.

```yaml
apiVersion: gateway.solo.io/v1
kind: VirtualService
metadata:
  name: httpbin-okta-vs
  namespace: gloo-system
spec:
  virtualHost:
    domains:
    - 'glootest.com'
    routes:
    - matchers:
      - prefix: /
      routeAction:
        single:
          upstream:
            name: default-httpbin-8000
            namespace: gloo-system
```

Run the following `glooctl` command to confirm that the new Route was accepted by Gloo Edge.

```shell
% glooctl get virtualservice httpbin-okta-vs
+-----------------+--------------+--------------+-----+----------+-----------------+----------------------------------+
| VIRTUAL SERVICE | DISPLAY NAME |   DOMAINS    | SSL |  STATUS  | LISTENERPLUGINS |              ROUTES              |
+-----------------+--------------+--------------+-----+----------+-----------------+----------------------------------+
| httpbin-okta-vs |              | glootest.com |     | Accepted |                 | / ->                             |
|                 |              |              |     |          |                 | gloo-system.default-httpbin-8000 |
|                 |              |              |     |          |                 | (upstream)                       |
+-----------------+--------------+--------------+-----+----------+-----------------+----------------------------------+
```

### Configure DNS and Test

Update your `/etc/hosts` file to resolve `glootest.com` by the IP address returned by the `glooctl proxy address` command (without the port number).

```shell
% glooctl proxy address
34.73.0.61:80

% tail -1 /etc/hosts
34.73.0.61 glootest.com
```

You can now access the application using the `glootest.com` domain.

```shell
% curl http://glootest.com/get
{
  "args": {},
  "headers": {
    "Accept": "*/*",
    "Content-Length": "0",
    "Host": "glootest.com",
    "User-Agent": "curl/7.64.1",
    "X-Envoy-Expected-Rq-Timeout-Ms": "15000"
  },
  "origin": "10.68.1.7",
  "url": "http://glootest.com/get"
}
```

Note that the `httpbin` service sends back information mirroring the request that we issued.

## Secure the application using HTTPS

In this section, we will begin securing the application by provisioning an https service endpoint.

For test purposes only, we'll begin by creating a self-signed certificate for the `glootest.com` domain.

```shell
% openssl req -x509 -nodes -days 365 -newkey rsa:2048 -keyout tls.key -out tls.crt -subj "/CN=glootest.com"
Generating a 2048 bit RSA private key
...+++
....+++
writing new private key to 'tls.key'
```

Second, we'll create a Kubernetes secret containing this certificate.

```shell
% kubectl create secret tls upstream-tls --key tls.key --cert tls.crt --namespace gloo-system
secret/upstream-tls created
```

Third, we enable HTTPS for our Virtual Service by using `kubectl` to apply the following change.

{{< highlight yaml "hl_lines=7-10" >}}
apiVersion: gateway.solo.io/v1
kind: VirtualService
metadata:
  name: httpbin-okta-vs
  namespace: gloo-system
spec:
  sslConfig:
    secretRef:
      name: upstream-tls
      namespace: gloo-system
  virtualHost:
    domains:
    - 'glootest.com'
    routes:
    - matchers:
      - prefix: /
      routeAction:
        single:
          upstream:
            name: default-httpbin-8000
            namespace: gloo-system
{{< /highlight >}}

Finally, we will use `curl` to confirm that we can access the new https endpoint.

```shell
% curl -k https://glootest.com/get
{
  "args": {},
  "headers": {
    "Accept": "*/*",
    "Content-Length": "0",
    "Host": "glootest.com",
    "User-Agent": "curl/7.64.1",
    "X-Envoy-Expected-Rq-Timeout-Ms": "15000"
  },
  "origin": "10.68.1.7",
  "url": "https://glootest.com/get"
}
```

## Authenticate with Okta OIDC

In this section, we will establish an Okta account and application, then modify our Gloo Edge configuration to authenticate using Okta.

### Establish Okta Account

If you are an existing Okta customer, then this section is optional for you.  But even if you are not an established Okta customer, it is easy to establish a free developer account that allows you to complete the integration exercise outlined in this guide.  First, visit the [developer signup page](https://developer.okta.com/signup/) and walk through their process.  Okta then provisions a developer account that you can access via a URL like this:  https://dev-2933640-admin.okta.com/ .  This provides access to an account dashboard and tools to manage Okta applications and users.

![Okta Developer Account Dashboard]({{% versioned_link_path fromRoot="/img/okta-dashboard.png" %}})

### Establish Okta Users

For new developer accounts, you need to establish one or more Okta users for testing.  The simplest quickstart approach for adding new users is via the [console](https://developer.okta.com/docs/guides/quickstart/add-user/), although Okta offers other options as well.  A full description is beyond the scope of this guide, and we recommend you follow Okta's own [technical docs](https://developer.okta.com/docs/guides/) to find the best approach for your requirements.

![Okta User List]({{% versioned_link_path fromRoot="/img/okta-user-list.png" %}})

### Establish Okta Application

You will need to establish an Okta application to integrate with Gloo Edge.  In this guide we prioritized providing a quickstart for testing over production readiness.  In establishing the Okta application from the dashboard wizard, we defined this as a `Web` type application, set a `Sign on method` of `OpenID Connect`, and gave the application a name `GlooTest`.  

![Okta New Application Dialog]({{% versioned_link_path fromRoot="/img/okta-create-new-app-integration.png" %}})

Beyond that, we changed only one of the default settings from the new-application wizard: `Login redirect URIs`, for which we provided a single value `https://glootest.com/callback`.  For more details on creating `Web` type application integrations with Okta, we found [this guide](https://developer.okta.com/docs/guides/implement-auth-code/overview/) helpful.

Our final Okta `GlooTest` application profile looked like this.

![Okta Application Profile]({{% versioned_link_path fromRoot="/img/okta-app-profile.png" %}})

Finally, ensure from the Okta application's Assignment tab that at least some of your Okta users have been assigned to your new application.

![Okta Application Assignments]({{% versioned_link_path fromRoot="/img/okta-app-assignments.png" %}})

### Establish Gloo Edge AuthConfig for Okta App

In this section we will establish the oauth secret and an AuthConfig resource to connect Gloo Edge with the OIDC provider.  Be sure to have your Okta client ID and client secret ready, available from the Okta application profile page, under `Client Credentials`.

Create the oauth secret in Kubernetes using `glooctl` with the Okta application secret.

```shell
% glooctl create secret oauth --namespace gloo-system --name okta-client-secret --client-secret $CLIENT_SECRET
+--------------------+-------+
|       SECRET       | TYPE  |
+--------------------+-------+
| okta-client-secret | OAuth |
+--------------------+-------+
```

Create a Gloo Edge AuthConfig object to finish connecting the gateway to the OIDC provider.  Use `kubectl` to apply this change.

```yaml
apiVersion: enterprise.gloo.solo.io/v1
kind: AuthConfig
metadata:
  name: okta-oidc
  namespace: gloo-system
spec:
  configs:
  - oauth2:
      oidcAuthorizationCode:
        app_url: https://glootest.com
        callback_path: /callback
        client_id: <insert-your-app-client-id-here>
        client_secret_ref:
          name: okta-client-secret
          namespace: gloo-system
        issuer_url: https://dev-2933640.okta.com/oauth2/default
        scopes:
        - email
```

Note that we have used the `scopes` parameter to indicate to the identity provider to include the `email` of the user in the claims of the JWT token it will return.

Finally, use `kubectl` to update the Virtual Service to use Okta OIDC authentication:

{{< highlight yaml "hl_lines=22-26" >}}
apiVersion: gateway.solo.io/v1
kind: VirtualService
metadata:
  name: httpbin-okta-vs
  namespace: gloo-system
spec:
  sslConfig:
    secretRef:
      name: upstream-tls
      namespace: gloo-system
  virtualHost:
    domains:
    - 'glootest.com'
    routes:
    - matchers:
      - prefix: /
      routeAction:
        single:
          upstream:
            name: default-httpbin-8000
            namespace: gloo-system
    options:
      extauth:
        configRef:
          name: okta-oidc
          namespace: gloo-system
{{< /highlight >}}

Note that the `/callback` path will be handled by this same Virtual Service because we used a catch-all `/` prefix matcher.

### Verify Okta Integration

{{< notice note >}}
You may encounter issues in completing this section.  If so, check out the `Troubleshooting` section immediately following this one.
{{< /notice >}}

We will now confirm that the initial Okta integration using a web browser.  First, navigate to https://glootest.com.  You should be redirected to the Okta Login page.  Sign in as one of your configured Okta users who is authorized for this application.

![Okta Sign In]({{% versioned_link_path fromRoot="/img/okta-sign-in.png" %}})

Gloo Edge has redirected you to the `/callback` endpoint we configured in the AuthConfig, with the information it received from Okta OIDC added as a query string to create a Cookie.  This cookie contains both an `access_token` and an `id_token` from Okta.  The `id_token` is a JWT from which we will extract claims to drive fine-grained RBAC decisions later in this exercise.  

After this callback, the normal request flow continues and the upstream application responds.  You should get output that looks something like below.  In particular, note the `Cookie` header supplied by Okta containing both an `access_token` and an `id_token`.

![GlooTest Response]({{% versioned_link_path fromRoot="/img/glootest-get-1.png" %}})

You can also test other `httpbin` endpoints via the Gloo Edge gateway.  For example, consider this base64 conversion service endpoint:  https://glootest.com/base64/R2xvbyBpcyBhd2Vzb21lCg==

![GlooTest Base64 Conversion]({{% versioned_link_path fromRoot="/img/httpbin-base64.png" %}})

### Troubleshooting Okta Integration

The examples in this guide were tested using both Safari and Chrome on MacOS.  You may experience some issues in development mode due to the use of self-signed certificates.  These present as 403 Forbidden errors, possibly with an `ERR_CERT_INVALID` error code.  With Safari, you can work through this by clicking through advanced settings and indicating you understand the risks.  With Chrome, you may need to use the `thisisunsafe` workaround described [here](https://medium.com/@dblazeski/chrome-bypass-net-err-cert-invalid-for-development-daefae43eb12).

You may experience browser issues if there is an overlap between the email of your Okta user and an active Google oauth connection in your browser.  Issuing these requests in Incognito (Chrome) or Private (Safari) windows resolves these problems.

It is common for initial requests that are routed through Okta, or any external security service provider, to fail due to an untuned `requestTimeout` parameter in the Gloo `Settings` object.  The default timeout is 200ms, which is often inadequate to account for the external network hop to Okta.  Increasing that timeout should resolve the problem.

You can get the current state of the `Settings` object like this:
```shell
% kubectl get settings.gloo.solo.io -n gloo-system -oyaml
```

Then apply a change to the `spec.extauth` stanza to add a `requestTimeout` greater than 200ms, like this:
```yaml
    extauth:
      requestTimeout: 1s
      extauthzServerRef:
        name: extauth
        namespace: gloo-system
```

## JWT Claim Extraction

The `id_token` contains a [JWT](https://jwt.io/) from which we can extract claims that may be useful in driving downstream RBAC policies.  In this section, we will enhance our Virtual Service by applying a transformation.  

### Transform Okta Cookie to JWT Header

It will use a regular expression to extract the JWT token from the Cookie header.  Then it will create a new `Jwt` header containing the token.  Finally, we will remove the cookie header from the request.

Apply these transformation changes to the Gloo Edge Virtual Service.

{{< highlight yaml "hl_lines=27-42" >}}
apiVersion: gateway.solo.io/v1
kind: VirtualService
metadata:
  name: httpbin-okta-vs
  namespace: gloo-system
spec:
  sslConfig:
    secretRef:
      name: upstream-tls
      namespace: gloo-system
  virtualHost:
    domains:
    - 'glootest.com'
    routes:
    - matchers:
      - prefix: /
      routeAction:
        single:
          upstream:
            name: default-httpbin-8000
            namespace: gloo-system
    options:
      extauth:
        configRef:
          name: okta-oidc
          namespace: gloo-system
      stagedTransformations:
        early:
          requestTransforms:
          - requestTransformation:
              transformationTemplate:
                extractors:
                  token:
                    header: 'cookie'
                    regex: '.*id_token=([^;]*).*'
                    subgroup: 1
                headers:
                  jwt:
                    text: '{{ token }}'
      headerManipulation:
        requestHeadersToRemove:
        - "cookie"
{{< /highlight >}}

Below is the type of output you should see when you refresh the web page.  Note that the `Cookie` header has been replaced by a `Jwt` header.

![GlooTest JWT Response]({{% versioned_link_path fromRoot="/img/glootest-get-2.png" %}})

If we paste the contents of the `Jwt` header into the JWT decoder at jwt.io, we can see some of the JWT claims that are available for us to make routing and authorization decisions.  In particular, note the `email` claim that we specified in the AuthConfig resource.

![JWT Claims Decoded]({{% versioned_link_path fromRoot="/img/jwt-claims-decoded.png" %}})

### Convert JWT to Request Header

In this section, we will use JWKS (JSON Web Key Set) to transform the JWT we extracted from the Okta callback into a specific `email` header that can drive fine-grained authorization decisions.  Okta publishes a read-only JWKS endpoint where public keys can be extracted that allow us to decode our JWT and then place its claims into request headers.  Details about how Okta publishes its JWKS keys is available [here](https://developer.okta.com/docs/guides/validate-id-tokens/overview/).

First, we need to specify a Gloo Edge Upstream that exposes the JWKS endpoint that Okta publishes for our development account.  Use `kubectl` to apply this Upstream to our cluster.

```yaml
apiVersion: gloo.solo.io/v1
kind: Upstream
metadata:
  name: okta-jwks
  namespace: gloo-system
spec:
  static:
    hosts:
      # This upstream identifies the host where Okta publishes the JWKS endpoint for my dev account
      # See https://dev-2933640-admin.okta.com/oauth2/default/.well-known/oauth-authorization-server
      - addr: dev-2933640.okta.com
        port: 443
```

Next, we will update our Virtual Service to use the JWKS upstream to decode the JWT and convert the `email` claim to a custom header `x-solo-claim-email`.  Apply these changes using `kubectl`.

{{< highlight yaml "hl_lines=43-58" >}}
apiVersion: gateway.solo.io/v1
kind: VirtualService
metadata:
  name: httpbin-okta-vs
  namespace: gloo-system

      stagedTransformations:
        early:
          requestTransforms:
          - requestTransformation:
              transformationTemplate:
                extractors:
                  token:
                    header: 'cookie'
                    regex: '.*id_token=([^;]*).*'
                    subgroup: 1
                headers:
                  jwt:
                    text: '{{ token }}'
      headerManipulation:
        requestHeadersToRemove:
        - "cookie"
      jwt:
        providers:
          okta:
            issuer: https://dev-2933640.okta.com/oauth2/default
            tokenSource:
              headers:
              - header: Jwt
            claimsToHeaders:
            - claim: email
              header: x-solo-claim-email
            jwks:
              remote:
                url: https://dev-2933640.okta.com/oauth2/default/v1/keys
                upstreamRef:
                  name: okta-jwks
                  namespace: gloo-system
{{< /highlight >}}

Refreshing the web page yields output like the following.  Note in particular that the `Jwt` header is removed and has been replaced by the `X-Solo-Claim-Email` header, whose contents match the `email` claim in the JWT from the Okta callback.

![JWT Claim to Header]({{% versioned_link_path fromRoot="/img/glootest-get-3.png" %}})

## Driving RBAC Decisions Using JWT Claims

In this section, we will use the `email` user identity extracted from the JWT to drive authorization decisions.  Let's apply it to a simple use case where we only want to allow the `jimhbarton@gmail.com` to have access to the httpbin `/get` endpoint but no others.

Apply the following change to your cluster using `kubectl`.

{{< highlight yaml "hl_lines=59-69" >}}

      rbac:

If authenticated using the `email` in the `rbac` policy, the `https://glootest.com/get` endpoint will respond in the web browser exactly as before.  However, authenticating as a different user or exercising a different endpoint will result in an `access denied` error like this.

![GlooTest Access Denied]({{% versioned_link_path fromRoot="/img/glootest-access-denied.png" %}})

## Cache the JWT in Redis

Let's briefly review where we are.  The request flow that we have constructed so far does the following:
* responds to initial calls on the Gloo endpoint by forwarding the user to an Okta authentication dialog
* accepts a callback from Okta containing a JWT in a cookie header
* extracts and validates the token from the cookie
* extracts "interesting" claims from the JWT, like the end user's email address
* adds new request headers based on those claims
* applies RBAC rules to determine if the request should be authorized based on those headers

While this approach is functional, some users will raise concerns about its security and scalability.  From a security standpoint, many will balk at holding bearer token information in the web browser.  They prefer the actual token to be stored on the server side with a simple pointer to it managed by the browser.  In addition, for some users this approach doesn't scale well to production deployments because a JWT with many claims can exceed cookie size thresholds enforced by web browsers.

For these reasons, Gloo offers a facility that allows users to cache the actual token in the Gloo Redis instance with only a handle stored in the browser.

To show this, we will expand our AuthConfig to use Redis to store our access token and simply hold a reference to it in a cookie named `okta-session`.  Apply these changes to your cluster.

{{< highlight yaml "hl_lines=19-24" >}}
apiVersion: enterprise.gloo.solo.io/v1
kind: AuthConfig
metadata:
  name: okta-oidc
  namespace: gloo-system
spec:
  configs:
  - oauth2:
      oidcAuthorizationCode:
        app_url: https://glootest.com
        callback_path: /callback
        client_id: <insert-your-app-client-id-here>
        client_secret_ref:
          name: okta-client-secret
          namespace: gloo-system
        issuer_url: https://dev-2933640.okta.com/oauth2/default
        scopes:
        - email
        session:
          failOnFetchFailure: true
          redis:
            cookieName: okta-session
            options:
              host: redis.gloo-system.svc.cluster.local:6379
{{< /highlight >}}

Then we will move back to a simpler Virtual Service that will enable us to see how Gloo manages our token.  Apply these changes to your cluster as well.

```yaml
apiVersion: gateway.solo.io/v1
kind: VirtualService
metadata:
  name: httpbin-okta-vs
  namespace: gloo-system
spec:
  sslConfig:
    secretRef:
      name: upstream-tls
      namespace: gloo-system
  virtualHost:
    domains:
    - 'glootest.com'
    routes:
    - matchers:
      - prefix: /
      routeAction:
        single:
          upstream:
            name: default-httpbin-8000
            namespace: gloo-system
    options:
      extauth:
        configRef:
          name: okta-oidc
          namespace: gloo-system
```

Refresh your web browser and note that the cookie now contains a single `okta-session` header as shown below.  This session header is not the JWT itself, but a pointer to a Redis key that now securely holds the JWT.

![Okta Session Cookie]({{% versioned_link_path fromRoot="/img/okta-session-cookie.png" %}})

## Re-establish JWT header to drive RBAC decisions

Now we have secured our JWT in that our web browser no longer holds a cookie containing our security token.  However, in doing this we have lost the ability to drive RBAC decisions based on claims inside the JWT.  

We will restore that capability in this section by configuring Gloo to fetch the token from Redis into a request header, and then we will use that header to drive RBAC decisions as before.

First, we will extend our AuthConfig to have Gloo place the JWT in a request header.

{{< highlight yaml "hl_lines=25-26" >}}
apiVersion: enterprise.gloo.solo.io/v1
kind: AuthConfig
metadata:
  name: okta-oidc
  namespace: gloo-system
spec:
  configs:
  - oauth2:
      oidcAuthorizationCode:
        app_url: https://glootest.com
        callback_path: /callback
        client_id: <insert-your-app-client-id-here>
        client_secret_ref:
          name: okta-client-secret
          namespace: gloo-system
        issuer_url: https://dev-2933640.okta.com/oauth2/default
        scopes:
        - email
        session:
          failOnFetchFailure: true
          redis:
            cookieName: okta-session
            options:
              host: redis.gloo-system.svc.cluster.local:6379
        headers:
          id_token_header: "jwt"
{{< /highlight >}}

After applying that AuthConfig change, note that the `Jwt` header re-appears in the list of headers returned from `httpbin`.

![Okta JWT Request Header]({{% versioned_link_path fromRoot="/img/okta-jwt-request.png" %}})

Now we can restore our Virtual Service's RBAC policies from the end of the previous session and confirm that they still work as before.  But now we are doing in a more secure way that does not risk exceeding cookie size thresholds in the web browser.

```yaml
apiVersion: gateway.solo.io/v1
kind: VirtualService
metadata:
  name: httpbin-okta-vs
  namespace: gloo-system
spec:
  sslConfig:
    secretRef:
      name: upstream-tls
      namespace: gloo-system
  virtualHost:
    domains:
    - 'glootest.com'
    routes:
    - matchers:
      - prefix: /
      routeAction:
        single:
          upstream:
            name: default-httpbin-8000
            namespace: gloo-system
    options:
      extauth:
        configRef:
          name: okta-oidc
          namespace: gloo-system
      headerManipulation:
        requestHeadersToRemove:
        - "cookie"
      jwt:
        providers:
          okta:
            issuer: https://dev-2933640.okta.com/oauth2/default
            tokenSource:
              headers:
              - header: Jwt
            claimsToHeaders:
            - claim: email
              header: x-solo-claim-email
            jwks:
              remote:
                url: https://dev-2933640.okta.com/oauth2/default/v1/keys
                upstreamRef:
                  name: okta-jwks
                  namespace: gloo-system
      rbac:
        policies:
          viewer:
            permissions:
              methods:
              - GET
              pathPrefix: /get
            principals:
            - jwtPrincipal:
                claims:
                  email: jimhbarton@gmail.com
```

Now when you refresh the browser, you should see just the `X-Solo-Claim-Email` header, which was used by Gloo to authorize the request.  Try a different endpoint, such as `https://glootest.com/base64/R2xvbyBpcyBhd2Vzb21lCg==`, and you will see the `RBAC: access denied` message.

![Okta Email Claim Success]({{% versioned_link_path fromRoot="/img/glootest-get-3.png" %}})

## Enable Logout Redirect to Remove Session Cookie

One final configuration option to consider is enabling Gloo to trigger removal of the Redis session token when the user's application session ends.  This is accomplished by configuring the `Logout redirect URIs` option on the Okta application to point to a URL that the Gloo AuthConfig is expecting.  You specify this in the AuthConfig by providing a `logoutPath:` URI.  One possibility is shown below.

              host: redis.gloo-system.svc.cluster.local:6379
        headers:
          id_token_header: "jwt"
        logoutPath: /logout
