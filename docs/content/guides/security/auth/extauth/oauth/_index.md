Gloo supports authentication via **OpenID Connect (OIDC)**. OIDC is an identity layer on top of the **OAuth 2.0** protocol. In OAuth 2.0 flows, authentication is performed by an external **Identity Provider** (IdP) which, in case of success, returns an **Access Token** representing the user identity. The protocol does not define the contents and structure of the Access Token, which greatly reduces the portability of OAuth 2.0 implementations.

The goal of OIDC is to address this ambiguity by additionally requiring Identity Providers to return a well-defined **ID Token**. OIDC ID tokens follow the [JSON Web Token]({{% versioned_link_path fromRoot="/guides/security/auth/jwt" %}}) standard and contain specific fields that your applications can expect and handle. This standardization allows you to switch between Identity Providers - or support multiple ones at the same time - with minimal, if any, changes to your downstream services; it also allows you to consistently apply additional security measures like _Role-based Access Control (RBAC)_ based on the identity of your users, i.e. the contents of their ID token (check out [this guide]({{% versioned_link_path fromRoot="/guides/security/auth/jwt/access_control" %}}) for an example of how to use Gloo to apply RBAC policies to JWTs). 

In this guide, we will focus on the format of the Gloo API for OIDC authentication.

{{% notice warning %}}
This feature requires Gloo's external auth server to communicate with an external OIDC provider/authorization server.
Because of this interaction, the OIDC flow may take longer than the default timeout of 200ms.
You can increase this timeout by setting the {{% protobuf name="enterprise.gloo.solo.io.Settings" display="`requestTimeout` value on external auth settings"%}}.
The external auth settings can be configured on the {{% protobuf name="gloo.solo.io.Settings" display="global Gloo `Settings` object"%}}.

## Configuration format

Following is an example of an `AuthConfig` with an OIDC configuration (for more information on `AuthConfig` CRDs, see the [main page]({{< versioned_link_path fromRoot="/guides/security/auth/extauth/#auth-configuration-overview" >}}) 
of the authentication docs):

{{< highlight yaml "hl_lines=8-17" >}}
apiVersion: enterprise.gloo.solo.io/v1
kind: AuthConfig
metadata:
  name: oidc
  namespace: gloo-system
spec:
  configs:
  - oauth:
      issuer_url: theissuer.com
      auth_endpoint_query_params:
        paramKey: paramValue
      app_url: myapp.com
      callback_path: /my/callback/path/
      client_id: myclientid
      client_secret_ref:
        name: my-oauth-secret
        namespace: gloo-system
      scopes:
      - email
{{< /highlight >}}

The `AuthConfig` consists of a single `config` of type `oauth`. Let's go through each of its attributes:

- `issuer_url`: The url of the OpenID Connect identity provider. Gloo will automatically discover OpenID Connect 
configuration by querying the `.well-known/openid-configuration` endpoint on the `issuer_url`. For example, if you are 
using Google as an identity provider, Gloo will expect to find OIDC discovery information at 
`https://accounts.google.com/.well-known/openid-configuration`.
- `auth_endpoint_query_params`: A map of query parameters appended to the issuer url in the form
 `issuer_url`?`paramKey`:`paramValue`. These query parameters are sent to the [authorization endpoint](https://auth0.com/docs/protocols/oauth2#oauth-endpoints)
  when Gloo initiates the OIDC flow. This can be useful when integrating Gloo with some identity providers that require
  custom parameters to be sent to the authorization endpoint.
- `app_url`: This is the public URL of your application. It is used in combination with the `callback_path` attribute.
- `callback_path`: The callback path relative to the `app_url`. Once a user has been authenticated, the identity provider 
will redirect them to this URL. Gloo will intercept requests with this path, exchange the authorization code received from 
the Identity Provider for an ID token, place the ID token in a cookie on the request, and forward the request to its original destination. 

{{% notice note %}}
The callback path must have a matching route in the VirtualService associated with the OIDC settings. For example, you could simply have a `/` path-prefix route which would match any callback path. The important part of this callback "catch all" route is that it goes through the routing filters including external auth. Please see the examples for Google and Dex.

- `client_id`: This is the **client id** that you obtained when you registered your application with the identity provider.
- `client_secret_ref`: This is a reference to a Kubernetes secret containing the **client secret** that you obtained 
when you registered your application with the identity provider. The easiest way to create the Kubernetes secret in the 
expected format is to use `glooctl`, but you can also provide it by `kubectl apply`ing YAML to your cluster:
{{< tabs >}}
{{< tab name="glooctl" codelang="shell">}}
glooctl create secret oauth --namespace gloo-system --name oidc --client-secret secretvalue
{{< /tab >}}
{{< tab name="kubectl" codelang="yaml">}}
apiVersion: v1
kind: Secret
type: Opaque
metadata:
  annotations:
    resource_kind: '*v1.Secret'
  name: oidc
  namespace: gloo-system
data:
  # The value is a base64 encoding of the following YAML:
  # client_secret: secretvalue
  # Gloo expects OAuth client secrets in this format.
  oauth: Y2xpZW50U2VjcmV0OiBzZWNyZXR2YWx1ZQo=

- `scopes`: scopes to request in addition to the `openid` scope.
