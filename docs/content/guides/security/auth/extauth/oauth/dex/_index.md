title: Authenticate with Dex
weight: 20
description: Integrating Gloo Edge and Dex Identity Provider
---

[Dex](https://dexidp.io/) is an **OpenID Connect identity hub**. Dex can be used to expose a consistent 
OpenID Connect interface to your applications while allowing your users to authenticate using their existing credentials 
from various back-ends, including LDAP, SAML, and other OIDC providers. Using an identity hub like Dex has the advantage 
of allowing you to change your authentication back-ends without affecting the rest of the system. 
You can also use Dex for authentication to the Kubernetes API server itself; for example, to allow LDAP logins to work 
with `kubectl`. This is outside the scope of this document, but you can read more about it 
[here](https://dexidp.io/docs/kubernetes/).

In this guide we will see how to authenticate users with your application via an OIDC flow that uses Dex as an identity 
provider. This guide is just an example to get you started and does not cover all aspects of a complete setup, 
like setting up a domain and SSL certificates.

## Setup
{{% notice warning %}}
This feature requires Gloo Edge's external auth server to communicate with an external OIDC provider/authorization server.
Because of this interaction, the OIDC flow may take longer than the default timeout of 200ms.
You can increase this timeout by setting the {{% protobuf name="enterprise.gloo.solo.io.Settings" display="`requestTimeout` value on external auth settings"%}}.
The external auth settings can be configured on the {{% protobuf name="gloo.solo.io.Settings" display="global Gloo Edge `Settings` object"%}}.

### Deploy sample application
{{% notice warning %}}
The sample `petclinic` application deploys a MySql server. If you are using `minikube` v1.5 to run this guide, this 
service is likely to crash due a `minikube` [issue](https://github.com/kubernetes/minikube/issues/5751). 
To get around this, you can start `minikube` with the following flag:

```shell
minikube start --docker-opt="default-ulimit=nofile=102400:102400" 
```
{{% /notice %}}

Let's deploy a sample web application that we will use to demonstrate these features:
```shell
kubectl apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/solo-io/gloo/v0.8.4/example/petclinic/petclinic.yaml
```

### Creating a Virtual Service
Now we can create a Virtual Service that routes all requests (note the `/` prefix) to the `petclinic` service.

```yaml
apiVersion: gateway.solo.io/v1
kind: VirtualService
metadata:
  name: petclinic
  namespace: gloo-system
spec:
  virtualHost:
    domains:
    - '*'
    routes:
    - matchers:
      - prefix: /
      routeAction:
        single:
          kube:
            ref:
              name: petclinic
              namespace: default
            port: 80
```

To verify that the Virtual Service has been accepted by Gloo Edge, let's port-forward the Gateway Proxy service so that it is 
reachable from your machine at `localhost:8080`:
```
kubectl -n gloo-system port-forward svc/gateway-proxy 8080:80
```

If you open your browser and navigate to [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080) you should see the following page (you might need to wait a 
minute for the containers to start):

![Pet Clinic app homepage]({{% versioned_link_path fromRoot="/img/petclinic-home.png" %}})

## Securing the Virtual Service
As we just saw, we were able to reach our application without having to provide any credentials. This is because by 
default Gloo Edge allows any request on routes that do not specify authentication configuration. Let's change this behavior. 
We will update the Virtual Service so that each request to the sample application is authenticated using an 
**OpenID Connect** flow.

### Install Dex
To implement the authentication flow, we need an OpenID Connect provider to be running in your cluster. To this end, we 
will deploy the [Dex](https://dexidp.io/) identity service, as it easy to install and configure.

Let's start by defining a `dex-values.yaml` Helm values file with some bootstrap configuration for Dex:

```yaml
cat > dex-values.yaml <<EOF
config:
  # The base path of dex and the external name of the OpenID Connect service.
  # This is the canonical URL that all clients MUST use to refer to dex. If a
  # path is provided, dex's HTTP service will listen at a non-root URL.
  issuer: http://dex.gloo-system.svc.cluster.local:32000

  # Instead of reading from an external storage, use this list of clients.
  staticClients:
  - id: gloo
    redirectURIs:
    - 'http://localhost:8080/callback'
    name: 'GlooApp'
    secret: secretvalue
  
  # A static list of passwords to login the end user. By identifying here, dex
  # won't look in its underlying storage for passwords.
  staticPasswords:
  - email: "admin@example.com"
    # bcrypt hash of the string "password"
    hash: "\$2a\$10\$2b2cU8CPhOTaGrs1HRQuAueS7JTT5ZHsHSzYiFPm1leZck7Mc8T4W"
    username: "admin"
    userID: "08a8684b-db88-4b73-90a9-3cd1661f5466"
EOF
```

This configures Dex with a static users. Notice how we choose a **client secret** with value `secretvalue` for the client named `gloo`. Gloo Edge will need to provide this secret when connecting to Dex in order to confirm its identity.

Note that the above configuration uses unsecured http traffic without SSL certificates. You can have Dex generate its own certificates by including settings for the Helm chart on the path `certs.web.altNames`. The names should be set to the fully-qualified domain name of the Dex service on Kubernetes and the Dex URL, which would be `dex.gloo-system.svc.cluster.local` and `https://dex.gloo-system.svc.cluster.local:32000`. You would then need to add the Dex web server certificate authority to Gloo Edge's external authentication so the web certificates used by the Dex service will be trusted. You can find more information about adding trusted CAs to the Ext Auth service [here]({{< versioned_link_path fromRoot="/installation/advanced_configuration/extauth_custom_ca/" >}}).

Using this configuration, we can deploy Dex to our cluster using Helm.

If `helm repo list` doesn't list the `stable` repo, invoke:

```shell
helm repo add stable https://charts.helm.sh/stable
```

And then install dex (helm 3 command follows):
```shell
helm install dex --namespace gloo-system stable/dex -f dex-values.yaml
```

#### Make the client secret accessible to Gloo Edge
To be able to act as our OIDC client, Gloo Edge needs to have access to the **client secret** we defined in the Dex configuration, 
so that it can use it to identify itself with the Dex authorization server. Gloo Edge expects the client secret to be stored 
in a specific format inside of a Kubernetes `Secret`. 

Let's create the secret and name it `oauth`:

{{< tabs >}}
{{< tab name="glooctl" codelang="shell">}}
glooctl create secret oauth --client-secret secretvalue oauth
{{< /tab >}}
{{< tab name="kubectl" codelang="yaml">}}
apiVersion: v1
kind: Secret
type: Opaque
metadata:
  annotations:
    resource_kind: '*v1.Secret'
  name: oauth
  namespace: gloo-system
data:
  # The value is a base64 encoding of the following YAML:
  # client_secret: secretvalue
  # Gloo Edge expects OAuth client secrets in this format.
  oauth: Y2xpZW50U2VjcmV0OiBzZWNyZXR2YWx1ZQo=
{{< /tab >}}
{{< /tabs >}} 
<br>

#### Create an AuthConfig
{{% notice warning %}}
{{% extauth_version_info_note %}}
{{% /notice %}}

Now that all the necessary resources are in place we can create the `AuthConfig` resource that we will use to secure our 
Virtual Service.

{{< highlight shell "hl_lines=8-22" >}}
apiVersion: enterprise.gloo.solo.io/v1
kind: AuthConfig
metadata:
  name: oidc-dex
  namespace: gloo-system
spec:
  configs:
  - oauth2:
      oidcAuthorizationCode:
        app_url: http://localhost:8080/
        callback_path: /callback
        client_id: gloo
        client_secret_ref:
          name: oauth
          namespace: gloo-system
        issuer_url: http://dex.gloo-system.svc.cluster.local:32000/
        scopes:
        - email
        session:
          cookieOptions:
            notSecure: true
{{< /highlight >}}

{{% notice note %}}
The above configuration uses the new `oauth2` syntax. The older `oauth` syntax is still supported, but has been deprecated.
{{% /notice %}}

The above configuration instructs Gloo Edge to use its extauth OIDC module to authenticate the incoming request. 
Notice how the configuration references the client secret we created earlier and compare the configuration values 
with the ones we used to bootstrap Dex.

#### Update the Virtual Service
Once the AuthConfig has been created, we can use it to secure our Virtual Service:

{{< highlight yaml "hl_lines=20-24" >}}
apiVersion: gateway.solo.io/v1
kind: VirtualService
metadata:
  name: petclinic
  namespace: gloo-system
spec:
  virtualHost:
    domains:
    - '*'
    routes:
    - matchers:
      - prefix: /
      routeAction:
        single:
          kube:
            ref:
              name: petclinic
              namespace: default
            port: 80
    options:
      extauth:
        configRef:
          name: oidc-dex
          namespace: gloo-system
{{< /highlight >}}

{{% notice note %}}
Note this is a simplistic example that has a `/` catch-all path prefix route. Gloo Edge needs to handle the `/callback` route and does so in the External Auth service. If you don't have a matching route (ie, either using a `/` or `/callback`) for the `callback` setting, you'll see `404`s when the Identity Provider tries to callback to Gloo Edge with the correct tokens. Please reach out to us on the [Slack](https://slack.solo.io) if you run into trouble here.

### Testing our configuration
The OIDC flow redirects the client (in this case, your browser) to a login page hosted by Dex. Since Dex is running in 
your cluster and is not publicly reachable, we need some additional configuration to make our example work. Please note 
that this is just a workaround to reduce the amount of configuration necessary for this example to work.

1. Port-forward the Dex service so that it is reachable from your machine at `localhost:32000`:
```shell
kubectl -n gloo-system port-forward svc/dex 32000:32000 & 
portForwardPid1=$! # Store the port-forward pid so we can kill the process later
```

1. Add an entry to the `/etc/hosts` file on your machine, mapping the `dex.gloo-system.svc.cluster.local` hostname to your 
`localhost` (the loopback IP address `127.0.0.1`).
```shell
echo "127.0.0.1 dex.gloo-system.svc.cluster.local" | sudo tee -a /etc/hosts
```

1. Port-forward the Gloo Edge Proxy service so that it is reachable from your machine at `localhost:8080`:
```
kubectl -n gloo-system port-forward svc/gateway-proxy 8080:80 &
portForwardPid2=$! # Store the port-forward pid so we can kill the process later
```

Now we are ready to test our complete setup! Open you browser and navigate to [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080). You should see the 
following login page:

![Dex login page]({{% versioned_link_path fromRoot="/img/dex-login.png" %}})

If you login as the `admin@example.com` user with the password `password`, Gloo Edge should redirect you to the main page 
of our sample application!

![Pet Clinic app homepage]({{% versioned_link_path fromRoot="/img/petclinic-home.png" %}})

If this does not work, one thing to check is the `requestTimeout` setting on your `extauth` Settings. See the warning in the [setup section](#setup) for more details.

### Logging

If Gloo Edge is running on kubernetes, the extauth server logs can be viewed with:
```
kubectl logs -n gloo-system deploy/extauth -f
```
If the auth config has been received successfully, you should see the log line:
```
"logger":"extauth","caller":"runner/run.go:179","msg":"got new config"
```

### Cleanup
You can clean up the resources created in this guide by running:

```
sudo sed '/127.0.0.1 dex.gloo-system.svc.cluster.local/d' /etc/hosts # remove line from hosts file
kill $portForwardPid1
kill $portForwardPid2
rm dex-values.yaml
helm delete --purge dex
kubectl delete -n gloo-system secret oauth dex-grpc-ca  dex-grpc-client-tls  dex-grpc-server-tls  dex-web-server-ca  dex-web-server-tls
kubectl delete virtualservice -n gloo-system petclinic
kubectl delete authconfig -n gloo-system oidc-dex
kubectl delete -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/solo-io/gloo/v0.8.4/example/petclinic/petclinic.yaml
```
