We recently released an updated version of the Gloo Portal. The new Gloo Portal adds a number of new features, 
including the ability to automatically generate routing configuration for your Gloo Edge installation based on your service 
specifications.

The new Gloo Portal is a standalone application that can be installed on top of **Gloo Edge Enterprise** starting with 
release v1.5.0-beta10. For more information, check out the 
[new Gloo Portal documentation](https://docs.solo.io/gloo-portal/latest).
