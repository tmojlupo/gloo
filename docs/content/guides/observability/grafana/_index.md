description: How to configure Grafana and consume the dashboards generated by Gloo Edge Enterprise
---

> **Note**: The built-in and generated dashboards described in these pages require Gloo Edge Enterprise

Gloo Edge automatically generates a Grafana dashboard for whole-cluster stats (overall request timing, aggregated response codes, etc.), and dynamically generates a more-specific dashboard for each upstream that is tracked. If you're already running your own instance of Grafana, however, Gloo Edge is also able to push this data to a configurable location.
