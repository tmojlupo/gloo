title: 1.5.0+ Upgrade Notice
weight: 5
description: Migrating to Gloo Edge 1.5.x and Gloo Edge Enterprise 1.5.x
---

In this guide we will describe the necessary steps to upgrade your Gloo Edge or Gloo Edge Enterprise deployments to their `1.5` 
versions using [Helm](https://github.com/helm/helm)
 
The guide assumes that you are running Gloo Edge 1.3.0+ or Gloo Edge Enterprise 1.3.0+. 
If you need to upgrade from earlier versions, you should consider an intermediate upgrade to the 1.3 versions. 
In this case, please refer to the [1.3.0 upgrade guide]({{< versioned_link_path fromRoot="/operations/upgrading/1.3.0" >}})

This upgrade guide also assumes that was gloo installed via `helm` or with `glooctl` version 1.2.0+
(i.e., gloo is a helm release named "gloo", which you can confirm exists by running `helm ls --all-namespaces`).

Also, please make sure to check out our 
[general configuration recommendations]({{< versioned_link_path fromRoot="/operations/upgrading/upgrade_steps#upgrading-the-server-components" >}}) 
to avoid downtime during upgrades.

### Upgrade prerequisites
You will need to have the following command line utilities installed:
 - [helm](https://github.com/helm/helm), either version 2.x or 3.x
 - `glooctl` version 1.2.5+ (optional)
 
### Upgrade steps

In Gloo Edge 1.5.0-beta8 and Gloo Edge Enterprise 1.5.0-beta3 we introduced a new 
[RateLimitConfig]({{% versioned_link_path fromRoot="/guides/security/rate_limiting/crds/" %}}) custom resource definition (CRD).
The new `RateLimitConfig` CRD will be automatically applied to your cluster when performing a `helm install` operation. 
However, it will not be applied when performing an upgrade. This is a [deliberate design choice](https://helm.sh/docs/topics/charts/#limitations-on-crds) 
on part of the Helm maintainers, given the risk associated with changing CRDs. 
Given this limitation, we need to apply the new CRD to the cluster before running `helm upgrade`. 

#### Installing the new RateLimitConfig CRD
You can add the new CRD to your cluster in two ways. The first is to simply supply a URL that points to the CRD template 
in the public [gloo GitHub repository](github.com//solo-io/gloo) to `kubectl apply`:

```shell script
kubectl apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/solo-io/gloo/v1.5.0/install/helm/gloo/crds/ratelimit_config.yaml
```

The second option involves using in the template that is shipped in the Gloo Edge and Gloo Edge enterprise charts.

{{< tabs >}}
{{% tab name="Gloo Edge - Helm 3" %}}
```shell script
helm repo update
helm pull gloo/gloo --version 1.5.0 --untar
kubectl apply -f gloo/crds/ratelimit_config.yaml
```
{{% /tab %}}
{{% tab name="Gloo Edge - Helm 2" %}}
```shell script
helm repo update
helm fetch gloo/gloo --version 1.5.0 --untar
kubectl apply -f gloo/crds/ratelimit_config.yaml
```
{{% /tab %}}

{{% tab name="Gloo Edge Enterprise - Helm 3" %}}
```shell script
helm repo update
helm pull glooe/gloo-ee --version 1.5.0 --untar
kubectl apply -f gloo-ee/charts/gloo/crds/ratelimit_config.yaml
```
{{% /tab %}}
{{% tab name="Gloo Edge Enterprise - Helm 2" %}}
```shell script
helm repo update
helm fetch glooe/gloo-ee --version 1.5.0 --untar
kubectl apply -f gloo-ee/charts/gloo/crds/ratelimit_config.yaml
```
{{% /tab %}}
{{< /tabs >}}


You can verify that the new CRD has been successfully applied by running the following command:

```shell script
kubectl get crds ratelimitconfigs.ratelimit.solo.io
```

#### Upgrading the Gloo Edge deployment
Now that we have installed the new CRD to cluster, you can upgrade your Gloo Edge deployment.

{{< tabs >}}
{{% tab name="Gloo Edge" %}}
```shell script
helm upgrade gloo gloo/gloo --namespace gloo-system --version 1.5.0
```
{{% /tab %}}

{{% tab name="Gloo Edge Enterprise" %}}
```shell script
helm upgrade gloo glooe/gloo-ee --namespace gloo-system --version 1.5.0 --set license_key=YOUR_LICENSE_KEY
```
{{% /tab %}}
{{< /tabs >}}

#### Verify upgrade
To verify that your upgrade was successful, let's first check the version:

```shell script
glooctl version
```

You should see the expected version for all the server components.

Let's also check that your Gloo Edge installation is healthy by running:

```shell script
glooctl check
```

If everything went well, you should see the following output:

```shell script
Checking deployments... OK
Checking pods... OK
Checking upstreams... OK
Checking upstream groups... OK
Checking auth configs... OK
Checking rate limit configs... OK
Checking secrets... OK
Checking virtual services... OK
Checking gateways... OK
Checking proxies... OK
Checking rate limit server... OK
No problems detected.
