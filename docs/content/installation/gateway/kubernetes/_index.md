Gloo Gateway can be installed on a Kubernetes cluster by using either the [`glooctl` command line tool](#installing-on-kubernetes-with-glooctl) or a [Helm chart](#installing-on-kubernetes-with-helm). The following document will take you through the process of either installation, [verifying the installation](#verify-your-installation), and [how to remove Gloo Gateway](#uninstall) if necessary.

{{% notice note %}}
Minimum required Kubernetes is 1.11.x. For older versions see our [release support guide]({{% versioned_link_path fromRoot="/reference/support/#kubernetes" %}})

## Installing the Gloo Gateway on Kubernetes

These directions assume you've prepared your Kubernetes cluster appropriately. Full details on setting up your
Kubernetes cluster [here]({{% versioned_link_path fromRoot="/installation/platform_configuration/cluster_setup/" %}}).

{{% notice note %}}
For certain providers with more strict multi-tenant security, like OpenShift, be sure to follow the cluster set up accordingly.

### Installing on Kubernetes with `glooctl`

Once your Kubernetes cluster is up and running, run the following command to deploy the Gloo Gateway to the `gloo-system` namespace:

```bash
glooctl install gateway
```

<details>
<summary>Special Instructions to Install Gloo on Kind</summary>
If you followed the cluster setup instructions for Kind [here]({{< versioned_link_path fromRoot="/installation/platform_configuration/cluster_setup/#kind-kubernetes-in-docker" >}}), then you should have exposed custom ports 31500 (for http) and 32500 (https) from your cluster's Docker container to its host machine. The purpose of this is to make it easier to access your service endpoints from your host workstation.  Use the following custom installation for Gloo to publish those same ports from the proxy as well.

```bash
cat <<EOF | glooctl install gateway --values -
gatewayProxies:
  gatewayProxy:
    service:
      type: NodePort
      httpPort: 31500
      httpsPort: 32500
      httpNodePort: 31500
      httpsNodePort: 32500
EOF
```

```
Creating namespace gloo-system... Done.
Starting Gloo installation...

Gloo was successfully installed!
```

Note also that the url to invoke services published via Gloo will be slightly different with Kind-hosted clusters.  Much of the Gloo documentation instructs you to use `$(glooctl proxy url)` as the header for your service url.  This will not work with kind.  For example, instead of using curl commands like this:

```bash
curl $(glooctl proxy url)/all-pets
```

You will instead route your request to the custom port that you configured above for your docker container to publish. For example:

```bash
curl http://localhost:31500/all-pets
```

Once you've installed Gloo, please be sure [to verify your installation]({{% versioned_link_path fromRoot="/installation/gateway/kubernetes/#verify-your-installation" %}}).


{{% notice note %}}
You can run the command with the flag `--dry-run` to output the Kubernetes manifests (as `yaml`) that `glooctl` will apply to the cluster instead of installing them.
Note that a proper Gloo installation depends on Helm Chart Hooks (https://helm.sh/docs/topics/charts_hooks/), so the behavior of your installation
may not be correct if you install by directly applying the dry run manifests, e.g. `glooctl install gateway --dry-run | kubectl apply -f -`.

### Installing on Kubernetes with Helm

{{% notice warning %}}

##### Helm 2 Compatibility
* Using Helm 2 with open source Gloo v1.2.3 and later or Gloo Enterprise v1.2.0 and later requires explicitly setting `crds.create=true`, as this is how we are managing compatibility between Helm 2 and 3.
* Helm 2 **IS NOT** compatible with the open source Gloo chart in Gloo versions v1.2.0 through v1.2.2.
* However, Helm 2 **IS** compatible with all stable versions of the Gloo Enterprise chart.
* `glooctl` prior to v1.2.0 cannot be used to install open source Gloo v1.2.0 and later or Gloo Enterprise v1.0.0 and later. 
{{% /notice %}}

As a first step, you have to add the Gloo repository to the list of known chart repositories, as well as prepare the installation namespace:

```shell
helm repo add gloo https://storage.googleapis.com/solo-public-helm
helm repo update
kubectl create namespace my-namespace
```

For an installation with all the default values, use one of the following commands:

{{< tabs >}}
{{% tab name="Helm 2" %}}
There are two options for installing with Helm 2. Note that in Gloo including and later than v1.2.3, you will have to explicitly set `crds.create=true`, as that is how we are managing compatibility between Helm 2 and 3.

You may use `helm install`:

```shell script
helm install --name gloo gloo/gloo --namespace my-namespace --set crds.create=true
```

or `helm template`:
```shell script
# download the gloo chart with helm cli. this is required 
# as helm template does not support remote repos
# https://github.com/helm/helm/issues/4527
helm fetch --untar --untardir . 'gloo/gloo'

# deploy gloo resources to my-namespace with our value overrides
helm template gloo --namespace my-namespace  --set crds.create=true | k apply -f - -n my-namespace
```
{{< /tab >}}
{{< tab name="Helm 3" codelang="shell">}}
helm install gloo gloo/gloo --namespace my-namespace
{{< /tab >}}
{{< /tabs >}}

Once you've installed Gloo, please be sure [to verify your installation]({{% versioned_link_path fromRoot="/installation/gateway/kubernetes/#verify-your-installation" %}}).

#### Customizing your installation with Helm

You can customize the Gloo installation by providing your own value file.

For example, you can create a file named `value-overrides.yaml` with the following content:

```yaml
global:
  glooRbac:
    # do not create kubernetes rbac resources
    create: false
settings:
  # configure gloo to write generated custom resources to a custom namespace
  writeNamespace: my-custom-namespace
```

and use it to override default values in the Gloo Helm chart:

{{< tabs >}}
{{< tab name="Helm 2" codelang="shell">}}
helm install gloo/gloo --name gloo-custom-0-7-6 --namespace my-namespace -f value-overrides.yaml
{{< /tab >}}
{{< tab name="Helm 3" codelang="shell">}}
helm install gloo-custom-0-7-6 gloo/gloo --namespace my-namespace -f value-overrides.yaml
{{< /tab >}}
{{< /tabs >}}

#### List of Gloo Helm chart values

The [Helm Chart Values page]({{< versioned_link_path fromRoot="/reference/helm_chart_values/" >}}) describes all the values that you can override in your custom values file.

## Verify your Installation

To verify that your installation was successful, check that the Gloo pods and services have been created. Depending on your install options, you may see some differences from the following example. If you choose to install Gloo into a namespace other than the default `gloo-system`, you will need to query your chosen namespace instead.

```shell
kubectl get all -n gloo-system
```

#### Looking for opened ports?
You will NOT have any open ports listening on a default install. For Envoy to open the ports and actually listen, you need to have a Route defined in one of the VirtualServices that will be associated with that particular Gateway/Listener. Please see the [Hello World tutorial to get started]({{% versioned_link_path fromRoot="/guides/traffic_management/hello_world/" %}}). 

{{% notice note %}}
NOT opening the listener ports when there are no listeners (routes) is by design with the intention of not over-exposing your cluster by accident (for security). If you feel this behavior is not justified, please let us know.

## Uninstall {#uninstall}

It's so hard to say goodbye. Actually, in this case it's not. 

### Uninstall with `glooctl`

To uninstall Gloo simply run the following.

```shell
glooctl uninstall
```
<video controls loop>
  <source src="https://solo-docs.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/gloo/videos/glooctl-uninstall.mp4" type="video/mp4">
</video>

If you installed Gloo to a different namespace, you will have to specify that namespace using the `-n` option:

```shell
glooctl uninstall -n my-namespace
```

The gloo-system namespace and Custom Resource Definitions created by the `glooctl install` command will not be removed. Those can also be deleted by running the following commands. Proceed with caution and only remove the CRDs if there are no more instances of Gloo Gateway in the cluster.

```shell
glooctl uninstall --all
```

---

## Next Steps

After you've installed Gloo, please check out our user guides on [Traffic Management]({{< versioned_link_path fromRoot="/guides/traffic_management/" >}}).
