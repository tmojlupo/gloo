# Regression tests
This directory contains tests that install each of the 3 Gloo Edge flavors (`gateway`, `ingress`, and `knative`) and run
regression tests against them.

*Note: All commands should be run from the root directory of the Gloo repository*

## Setup
For these tests to run, we require the following conditions:
  - Gloo Edge Helm chart archive be present in the `_test` folder,
  - `glooctl` be built in the`_output` folder
  - kind cluster set up and loaded with the images to be installed by the helm chart

#### (Option A) - Use the CI Install Script (preferred)

`ci/deploy-to-kind-cluster.sh` (`https://github.com/solo-io/gloo/blob/master/ci/deploy-to-kind-cluster.sh`) gets run in CI to setup the test environment for the above requirements.
It accepts a number of environment variables, to control the creation of a kind cluster and deployment of Gloo resources to that kind cluster.

| Name                  | Default   | Description |
| ---                   |   ---     |    ---      |
| CLUSTER_NAME          | kind      | The name of the cluster that will be generated |
| CLUSTER_NODE_VERSION  | v1.17.0   | The version of the Node Docker image to use for booting the cluster |
| VERSION               | kind      | The version used to tag Gloo images that are deployed to the cluster |

Example:
```bash
CLUSTER_NAME=solo-test-cluster CLUSTER_NODE_VERSION=v1.17.0 VERSION=v1.0.0-solo-test ci/deploy-to-kind-cluster.sh
```

#### (Option B) - Manually Run Make Targets

The CI install script executes a series of make targets.

Create a kind cluster: `kind create cluster --name kind`\
Build the helm chart: `VERSION=kind make build-test-chart`\
Build glooctl: `make glooctl`\
Load the images into the cluster: `CLUSTER_NAME=kind VERSION=kind make push-kind-images`


## Verify Your Setup
Before running your tests, it's worthwhile to verify that a cluster was created, and the proper images have been loaded.

```bash
kubectl get nodes
docker exec -ti <nodename> bash
crictl images
```

You should see the list of images in the cluster, including the ones you just uploaded

#### Common Setup Errors
`Error: validation: chart.metadata.version "solo" is invalid`\
In newer versions of helm (>3.5), the version used to build the helm chart (ie the VERSION env variable), needs to respect semantic versioning. This error implies that the version provided does not.

## Run Tests

To run the regression tests, your kubeconfig file must point to a running Kubernetes cluster.
`kubectl config current-context` should run `kind-<CLUSTER_NAME>`

#### (Option A) - Use the Make Target (preferred)

Use the same command that CI relies on:
```bash
KUBE2E_TESTS=<test-to-run> make run-ci-regression-tests
```

#### (Option B) - Use Ginkgo Directly

The make target just runs ginkgo with a set of useful flags. If you want to control the flags that are provided, you can run:
```bash
KUBE2E_TESTS=<test-to-run> ginkgo -r <other-flags>
```

#### Test Environment Variables
The below table contains the environment variables that can be used to configure the test execution.

| Name              | Default   | Description |
| ---               |   ---     |    ---      |
| KUBE2E_TESTS      | ""        | Name of the test suite to be run. Options: `'gateway', 'ingress', 'knative', 'helm', 'gloomtls', 'glooctl', 'eds'` |
| DEBUG             | 0         | Set to 1 for debug log output |
| WAIT_ON_FAIL      | 0         | Set to 1 to prevent Ginkgo from cleaning up the Gloo Edge installation in case of failure. Useful to exec into inspect resources created by the test. A command to resume the test run (and thus clean up resources) will be logged to the output.
| TEAR_DOWN         | false     | Set to true to uninstall Gloo after the test suite completes |

#### Common Test Errors
`getting Helm chart version: expected a single entry with name [gloo], found: 5`\
The test helm charts are written to the `_test` directory, with the `index.yaml` file containing references to all available charts. The tests require that this file contain only 1 entry. Delete the other entries manually, or run `make clean` to delete this folder entirely, and then re-build the test helm chart.
